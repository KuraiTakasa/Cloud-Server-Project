This document contains step-by-step instructions on how I created my cloud server project.

### Step 1 ###

First, we launch an instance.

Name it.

Then select the Ubuntu operating system.

Now select an existing key pair, or create a new one.

Create a new security group so we can edit it later. Additionally, allowing access from anywhere is risky; however, my main network IP address is dynamic, and I would need to update the allowed IP address in my network settings each time I log in.

Leave the storage as the default configuration.
